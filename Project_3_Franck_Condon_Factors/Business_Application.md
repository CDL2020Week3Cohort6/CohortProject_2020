# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

The questions for business applications of the problem solved in week 3 project have been addressed here.

## Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

A common past approach to material engineering has been:

-Investing resources into engineering candidate materials,

eg: designing an organic semiconductor for display technology

-Integrating them into the technology of interest,

eg: coming up with a way to integrate the organic semiconductor material into a display

-Testing their efficacy with respect to the application of interest

eg: testing performance characteristics like: contrast, brightness, energy saving, durability, viewing from an angle

As we gain more computational power for calculating the properties of molecular systems, it becomes more feasible to consider material engineering challenges from a microscopic perspective. That is, it becomes practical to engineer materials directly from first principles, rather than by trial and error.

One such approach involves calculating the “vibronic spectra” of molecular structures. Vibronic spectra are a characterisation of the frequencies at which a molecule switches between different modes of overall vibration and electronic excitation (vibration of electrons relative to the backbone of the molecule). Understanding these transitions, helps us understand a lot about how a molecule will behave when subject to certain conditions, or when interacting with other types of molecules.

In our display technology example we might be able to use vibronic spectra to come up with a good estimate for some of the performance characteristics measured in point 3, thereby saving us a large amount of R&D resources.

## Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Franck-Condon analysis enables us to study vibronic progressions in molecules. The modeling of vibronic progressions in optical absorption requires a knowledge of the vibrational properties in the excited state potential. Study of vibronic progressions is important for understanding several properties of organic semiconductors.[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1016/B0-12-369401-9/00658-6).

**Organic semiconductor** devices now form the basis of an ongoing revolution in electronics in the twenty‐first century. Organic materials having well‐defined electrical properties are being deployed for optoelectronic devices such as **organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs)**. OLEDs are now displacing the use of liquid crystal displays in consumer electronics such as cell phones, tablets, and televisions. Organic materials generally can be classified into small‐molecule organic materials and large‐molecule organic materials. Conjugated polymers are suitable candidates for both organic solar cells and OLEDs.

The OLEDs provide advantages in follwing manner[[3]](https://www.oled-info.com/oled-introduction#:~:text=An%20OLED%20display%20have%20the,flexible%2C%20foldable%20and%20transparent%20displays) and thus may revolutionize the electronics :

-Improved image quality - better contrast, higher brightness, fuller viewing angle, a wider color range and much faster refresh rates.

-Lower power consumption.

-Simpler design that enables ultra-thin, flexible, foldable and transparent displays

-Better durability - OLEDs are very durable and can operate in a broader temperature range
